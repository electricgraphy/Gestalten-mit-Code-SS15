// Order of code execution
// The basic model is called 'imperative' programming
// where one step follows another

// Step 1 in time
println("do this");

// Step 2 in time
println("do that");

// Step 3 in time
println("and so on ...");

// Every step has to wait until the previous step is executed and finised.
